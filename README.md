As part of the homework for Module 1, you need to install and configure the development environment. All detailed steps are described in topics 3-5.

Brief description of your actions:

Create a GitHub repository called goit-typescript-hw-01.
Set up the development environment (Module 1.3 "Installing and configuring the development environment").
Configure the compiler (Module 1.4 "Configuring the Compiler").
Optional task: Set up source maps in tsconfig.json in the TypeScript project to debug code in a browser (Module 1.5, Debugging).
It should be ready if you already started installing and configuring the environment while studying the module. In this case, you do not need to repeat these steps.

For the assignment to be successfully credited, you must send your tutor a link to your repository for verification.
